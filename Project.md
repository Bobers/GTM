GTM Navigator - Product Requirements Document

Version: 17.1 (Final Executable Blueprint)
Date: July 24, 2025
Status: Ready for Implementation

1. Vision & Strategy
1.1 Product Overview

GTM Navigator is an interactive workspace that provides a single source of truth for go-to-market strategy. It guides founders through a stage-gated framework, connecting foundational business assumptions to testable experiments and measurable progress.

1.2 Problem Statement

Founders struggle to keep teams focused on the same GTM plan; critical decisions get lost across scattered tools, leading to confusion, wasted cycles, and missed opportunities. Users need a single, living workspace that makes strategy, experiments, and progress visibleâ€”so everyone can move faster, learn together, and win their market.

2. Success Metrics & Learning Objectives
2.1 Quantitative Metrics (MVP Success Criteria)

A successful MVP release must achieve the following within 60 days of launch:

Core Activation Metric: >50% of new users who create a project complete the entire "Strategic Canvas" (View 1). An "activated user" is defined as a user who spends more than 5 minutes on the canvas and fills in at least 3 distinct fields.

Time-to-Value: Median time for an activated user to complete the canvas is < 45 minutes.

Cycle Engagement: >30% of activated users complete at least one full PMF Cycle iteration.

Meaningful Retention Signal: >15% of activated users return within 7 days and make at least one meaningful update to their project.

2.2 Qualitative Metrics & Learning Objectives

User Sentiment: Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 40+ from an in-app survey sent to activated users after 14 days.

Validate Core Value Prop: In user interviews with 5-10 activated users, the theme of "having everything in one place" must be a top-3 mentioned benefit.

Identify Onboarding Friction: Analyze the drop-off points for the 50% of users who do not activate to identify the single biggest obstacle in the onboarding flow.

2.3 Non-Goals for MVP

AI Co-Pilot features (suggestions, analysis).

Multi-user collaboration or team accounts.

Backend user authentication (will use localStorage).

Third-party integrations.

3. Core Product Views & UI Specification
3.1 View 1: The Strategic Canvas

Purpose: To establish and view the foundational, high-level strategy for the entire project.

Layout Description: A single-screen view organized into four distinct horizontal sections.

Section 1: Market Truths

A full-width, rounded container with the label: "Here is what we know to be true about our target market:".

Inside, there are three editable, yellow, sticky-note-style text input components, arranged horizontally.

Section 2: The Core PMF Inputs & Engine

This section is comprised of three main vertical boxes.

Left Box: Labeled "PRODUCT". It contains two questions, each with a rectangular yellow input field below it: "What is your product?" and "What problem it solves?".

Center Box: Displays the "The Product-Market Fit cycle" diagram. This diagram is interactive.

Right Box: Labeled "TARGET CUSTOMER". It contains the question "Whom do you plan to sell to?" with a single yellow sticky-note-style input field below it.

Section 3: The GTM Pillars

A row of three distinct, rounded containers, arranged horizontally:

"Competitive Alternatives": "How are customers currently solving this problem?"

"Competitive Edge (UVP)": "Why are you the best?"

"Pricing and Packaging": "How, how much and when to charge?"

Section 4: The GTM Objective

A full-width, rounded container labeled: "Your GTM Objective in 3-6 Months". Inside, it contains the question: "What does your success look like to you?" with three editable, yellow, sticky-note-style text input components below.

3.2 View 2: The Stages of GTM Navigator

Purpose: To serve as the primary navigational hub for the user's journey.

Layout Description: A horizontal, multi-step process view with the title "Stages of Your Go-to-Market Strategy". It consists of five sequential, rectangular containers, each representing a stage:

Stage 0: "Proof of concept" (Goal: "How will you get the first [x] testers / free users to test the product?")

Stage 1: "Proof of monetization" (Goal: "How will you get your first [x] customers?")

Stage 2: "Proof of at least one scalable GTM motion" (Goal: "How will you get more customers predictably?")

Stage 3: "Proof of sustainable business model" (Goal: "What needs to happen for you to be break-even/profitable?")

Stage 4: "Proof of market expansion" (Goal: "Which markets do you plan to win next?")

Each stage must visually indicate its status (locked, active, complete). The active stage is highlighted and is the only one clickable to proceed to View 3.

3.3 View 3: The GTM Strategy Trio Module

Purpose: To define the specific strategy for the currently active GTM stage.

Layout Description: A three-column view.

Column 1: "Beachhead Strategy": Contains a visual component and a yellow input field for the user to name their chosen segment.

Column 2: "Validation": Titled "Select at least 2 validation methods," it displays a checklist of methods (e.g., Interviews, Surveys, Testing MVP).

Column 3: "GTM Motions": Titled "You can select 2-3 as initial," it displays a list of selectable motions (e.g., Inbound, Outbound, Community).

Bottom Section: Contains an area for "Why we think these things will work?" (three sticky notes) and an area for "Growth motions KPIs:" (three text fields).

3.4 User Experience: Friction & Delight

Friction Mitigation:

Onboarding: A "guided setup" will focus new users on one canvas section at a time.

Interaction Cues: All clickable elements must have clear hover states and tooltips.

Stateful Persistence: Aggressive localStorage saving ensures no work is lost on refresh.

Delight Features:

Achievement Unlocked: After completing a GTM stage, users receive a founder-themed digital "badge" (e.g., "The Proof of Concept Pioneer") accompanied by a concise, data-driven tip.

Momentum Micro-interactions: When a user completes a major section, a brief, playful confetti animation provides emotional payoff.

4. Execution Plan & Ownership

Overall Project Lead (Product, Eng, QA, Rollout): Bogdan

4.1 Phase 1: The Static Canvas & Core State (2 Weeks)

Phase Owner: Bogdan

Acceptance Criteria:

A new project can be created and assigned a unique ID.

All UI components for the "Strategic Canvas" (View 1) are rendered.

All text fields and sticky notes are editable.

The complete GTM_Project state object is successfully saved to localStorage on every user input.

The project state is successfully reloaded from localStorage on page refresh.

Acceptance sign-off by: Bogdan.

4.2 Phase 2: The Interactive GTM & PMF Cycle (3 Weeks)

Phase Owner: Bogdan

Acceptance Criteria:

Technical Spike (Max 3 days): Evaluate react-flow vs. custom SVG for the PMF Cycle diagram. A decision report with a PoC and estimated timeline is due by Day 3.

A user can select their active GTM Stage.

The "GTM Strategy Trio" (View 3) is functional and saves data correctly.

The PMF Cycle diagram is interactive; clicking a stage opens a data entry module.

Data from the PMF Cycle module is saved to the pmfCycleLog array for the active stage.

The "Pivot" and "Validate" logic is functional.

Acceptance sign-off by: Bogdan.

4.3 Phase 3: Stage Gating & Launch Polish (1 Week)

Phase Owner: Bogdan

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can mark the active GTM stage as "complete."

The UI visually locks the completed stage and unlocks the next one.

The "guided setup" onboarding flow and all "delight" features are implemented.

Acceptance sign-off by: Bogdan.

5. Technical Specification
5.1 Open Questions & Risk Mitigation

Technical Risks:

Risk: localStorage has a ~5MB storage limit.

Mitigation: Accepted MVP risk. The UI will display a non-blocking warning if storage exceeds 80% capacity. The data model is designed for straightforward migration.

Risk: PMF Cycle interactivity is a larger engineering lift than estimated.

Mitigation: The 3-day technical spike will determine feasibility. The hard MVP cutoff decision is to replace the interactive diagram with a simple checklist.

Risk: Accessibility & Performance.

Mitigation (MVP): The initial target is modern desktop browsers. Full accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) is a non-goal for the MVP.

User Experience Risks:

Risk: Users abandon the process during onboarding.

Mitigation: Basic funnel analytics will be implemented to track which step in the onboarding has the highest drop-off rate, making it the first area to iterate on post-launch.

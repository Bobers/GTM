Of course. Here is the final, fully self-contained document. It integrates the detailed implementation plan into the complete PRD structure, providing Bogdan with a single, comprehensive blueprint for execution.

GTM Navigator - Final Implementation Blueprint

Version: 18.0 (Build-Ready)
Date: July 24, 2025
Status: Final, Self-Contained Specification

1. Vision & Strategy
1.1 Product Overview

GTM Navigator is an interactive workspace that provides a single source of truth for go-to-market strategy. It guides founders through a stage-gated framework, connecting foundational business assumptions to testable experiments and measurable progress.

1.2 Problem Statement

Founders struggle to keep teams focused on the same GTM plan; critical decisions get lost across scattered tools, leading to confusion, wasted cycles, and missed opportunities. Users need a single, living workspace that makes strategy, experiments, and progress visible—so everyone can move faster, learn together, and win their market.

2. Success Metrics & Learning Objectives
2.1 Measurable Outcomes (MVP Success Criteria)

A successful MVP release must achieve the following within 60 days of launch:

Core Activation Metric: >50% of new users who create a project complete the entire "Strategic Canvas" (View 1). An "activated user" is defined as a user who spends more than 5 minutes on the canvas and fills in at least 3 distinct fields.

Time-to-Value: Median time for an activated user to complete the canvas is < 45 minutes.

Cycle Engagement: >30% of activated users complete at least one full PMF Cycle iteration.

Meaningful Retention Signal: >15% of activated users return within 7 days and make at least one meaningful update to their project.

2.2 Non-Goals for MVP

AI Co-Pilot features.

Multi-user collaboration or team accounts.

Backend user authentication (will use localStorage).

Third-party integrations.

3. Core Product Views & UI Specification

(This section describes the required interfaces. The full layout is detailed for clarity.)

3.1 View 1: The Strategic Canvas

Purpose: To establish and view the foundational, high-level strategy for the entire project.

Layout Description: A single-screen view organized into four distinct horizontal sections.

Section 1: Market Truths: A full-width container labeled "Here is what we know to be true about our target market:" containing three editable, yellow, sticky-note-style text input components.

Section 2: The Core PMF Inputs & Engine: A three-column layout.

Left Box: Labeled "PRODUCT," containing inputs for "What is your product?" and "What problem it solves?".

Center Box: Displays the interactive "The Product-Market Fit cycle" diagram.

Right Box: Labeled "TARGET CUSTOMER," with an input for "Whom do you plan to sell to?".

Section 3: The GTM Pillars: A row of three containers for "Competitive Alternatives," "Competitive Edge (UVP)," and "Pricing and Packaging."

Section 4: The GTM Objective: A full-width container labeled "Your GTM Objective in 3-6 Months" with three editable sticky notes for "What does your success look like to you?".

3.2 View 2: The Stages of GTM Navigator

Purpose: The primary navigational hub for the user's journey.

Layout Description: A horizontal, multi-step process view showing five sequential stages from "Proof of concept" to "Proof of market expansion." Each stage must visually indicate its status (locked, active, complete).

3.3 View 3: The GTM Strategy Trio Module

Purpose: To define the specific strategy for the currently active GTM stage.

Layout Description: A three-column view for defining the "Beachhead Strategy," selecting "Validation" methods, and choosing "GTM Motions," with a shared bottom section for rationale ("Why we think these things will work?") and KPIs.

4. Implementation Plan & Task List

This is the detailed, sprint-by-sprint plan for building the MVP.

Overall Project Lead: Bogdan

Sprint 0: Project Initialization & Setup (2 Days)

Run npx create-next-app@latest --ts.

Set up project structure: /app/(views), /components, /hooks, /state, /lib.

Inside /app/(views), create initial directories: /canvas, /stages, /strategy/[stageId].

Run npm install zustand uuid lucide-react framer-motion.

Create /lib/types.ts and define all interfaces (GTM_Project, GTM_Stage_Data, PMF_Cycle_Iteration).

Create /state/projectStore.ts with the initial state shape and basic actions (createNewProject).

Sprint 1: The Core Persistence & First View (4 Days)

Navigation: Set up routing in /app/layout.tsx to direct new users to /canvas/[projectId].

State: Create the usePersistence hook to save/load the Zustand store to/from localStorage.

Component & Wiring: Build and wire all static canvas components (ProductBox, MarketTruthsBox, TargetCustomerBox, CompetitiveAlternativesBox, CompetitiveEdgeBox, PricingBox, GtmObjectiveBox) into the /app/canvas/[projectId]/page.tsx view.

Acceptance Criteria: A user can fill out the entire Strategic Canvas, and all data persists on refresh.

Sprint 2: The Navigational Hub & Strategy Trio (4 Days)

Component: Build /components/navigation/StagesNavigator.tsx. It must visually reflect the status of each stage ('locked', 'active', 'complete').

View: Create /app/stages/page.tsx, displaying the <StagesNavigator />.

Navigation: Implement the flow: Canvas → Stages → Strategy (/app/strategy/[stageId]/page.tsx). Clicking locked stages should be disabled.

Component: Build the three-column UI for the /app/strategy/[stageId]/page.tsx view.

Component: Build the specific interactive components for the GTM Strategy Trio, including input validation (e.g., min/max selections).

Wiring: All selections in the GTM Strategy Trio must correctly update the active GTM_Stage_Data object in the store.

Acceptance Criteria: A user can navigate between views and fully define their strategy for the active stage.

Sprint 3: The PMF Engine & Stage Gating (5 Days)

(Spike - Day 1): Finalize react-flow vs. custom SVG decision for the PMF Cycle diagram.

Component Integration: Place the interactive <PmfCycleDiagram /> in the center column of the canvas view, between the Product and Target Customer boxes.

Component: Build the generic /components/modals/PmfCycleStageModal.tsx.

Logic: Implement the full PMF cycle interactivity (opening modals, saving data to pmfCycleLog, pivot/validate logic).

Component: Build /components/pmf/PmfHistory.tsx to display archived iterations and place it below the PMF Cycle diagram.

Stage Gating Logic:

Add the "Mark Stage as Complete" button to the /app/strategy/[stageId] view.

Implement the completeActiveStage() action, which sets the current stage to complete and the next stage to active.

Acceptance Criteria: The PMF cycle is fully functional, and users can officially complete a stage to unlock the next one.

Sprint 4: Polish, Metrics, and Error Handling (4 Days)

UI Polish: Implement all required hover states and tooltips.

Delight Features:

Create /components/modals/BadgeModal.tsx for the "Achievement Unlocked" feature.

Integrate framer-motion for the confetti and checkmark micro-interaction animations.

Onboarding: Build the /components/onboarding/GuidedSetup.tsx to guide new users through the canvas sequentially.

Storage Monitoring:

Create the useStorageMonitor hook to calculate localStorage usage.

Create a /components/ui/StorageWarning.tsx to display a warning if usage exceeds 80%.

Error Handling:

Implement basic error boundaries in each primary view.

Add a 404 - Not Found page for invalid project or stage IDs.

Create a fallback UI component to display if localStorage fails.

Analytics Implementation:

Create a useAnalytics hook with a trackEvent function.

Implement tracking for all specified success metrics (activation, time-to-value, cycle engagement, meaningful return).

Acceptance Criteria: The application is robust, tracks all necessary metrics, and is ready for beta testing.

Sprint 5: Pre-Launch Readiness (2 Days)

Create the Tally.so feedback form and link the "Feedback" button in the UI.

Build the invite-only landing page.

Perform a final, end-to-end QA pass by Bogdan and a final review by Alex.

Write a README.md with setup and deployment instructions.

Acceptance Criteria: The project is ready to be deployed and shared with the first beta users.

5. Technical Specification & Data Model
5.1 Risk Mitigation

localStorage Limits: An accepted MVP risk. A UI warning will be displayed if storage exceeds 80% capacity.

PMF Cycle Complexity: A 3-day technical spike is allocated to de-risk this. The hard MVP cutoff is to replace the interactive diagram with a simple checklist if it proves too complex.

5.2 Data Model: GTM_Project

  iterationId: string;
